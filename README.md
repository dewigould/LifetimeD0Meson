# LifetimeD0Meson


Three scripts submitted:
- New.py
- to_run.py
- part5.py

part5.py implements the rejection method.

New.py contains all the bulk of my code used to calculate the lifetime of the D0 meson from a set of data.

to_run.py contains simple blocks of code that can be executed to obtain a bunch of standard results and figures.

The to_run file contains a whole pile of Boolean switches that you can play with to toggle which graphs you see at any one time. They are all commented and explained in-line.
